                <h3>GUIDE ABOUT LEARNING QURAN WITH TAJWEED</h3>
                <p>The tajweed is what makes Quran reciting so beautiful. Tajweed itself means success or ‘doing something successfully’ implying that there are rules to follow. When it comes to Quran recitation, following the tajweed guidelines means reading the Quran with such accuracy that each letter is given its own set of qualities. <br> Tajweed is a word that those who have learned to recite the Quran are familiar with. The word’s literal meaning is ‘to perfect, adorn, or improve.’ On the other hand, Tajweed is a set of rules that reciters must follow to guarantee that each letter can pronounce correctly.</p>
